Given a string, s, matching the regular expression [A-Za-z !,?._'@]+, split the string into tokens. 
We define a token to be one or more consecutive English alphabetic letters. Then, print the number of tokens, 
followed by each token on a new line.

Note: You may find the String.split method helpful in completing this challenge.

Input Format

A single string, s.

Output Format

On the first line, print an integer, n, denoting the number of tokens in string s (they do not need to be unique). Next, print each of the n tokens 
on a new line in the same order as they appear in input string s.

Sample Input

Sample Output
