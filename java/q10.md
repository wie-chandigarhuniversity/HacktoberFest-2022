Java's BigDecimal class can handle arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers. Let's test your knowledge of them!

Given an array, s, of n real number strings, sort them in descending order — but wait, there's more! Each number 
must be printed in the exact same format as it was read from stdin, meaning that .1 is printed as .1, and 0.1 is printed as 0.1. 
If two numbers represent numerically equivalent values (e.g., .1=0.1), then they must be listed in the same order as they were received as input).

Output Format

Locked stub code in the editor will print the contents of array s to stdout. You are only responsible for reordering the array's elements.
